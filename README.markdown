Requires SFML

Always use a different build directory from the source to keep it clean.

    * Install CMake
    * Build SFML, shared libraries, and install to default location
    * Run CMake, make on this.
    * Spider-Fish.app will be generated, and will work on the build machine
    
Windows:
    * Not working yet, next step
